RPG BUILDER COMMUNITY LICENSE 1.0.0
(c) 2025 Blink Studios
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IN SHORT:
• Make games, sell games: Any number of commercial or free games
  built with RPG Builder are totally fine. You never owe us royalties.

• Tinker all you like: Fork the code, add features, keep it in‑house or contribute,
  Internal studio tools, jam projects, side–quests… go wild!

• You cannot sell the editor: You can’t ship, market, rent, or
  otherwise provide RPG Builder itself (or your custom fork of it) to
  other people. That includes asset‑store listings, one time purchases or SaaS offerings.

• Sharing back is optional but appreciated: Pull requests are
  welcome but they aren’t required.

• We keep the name: “RPG Builder” stays a Blink Studios thing.
